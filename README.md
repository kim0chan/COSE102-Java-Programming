# AnamWeatherBot
A simple chatbot on Telegram that reports on the weather in Anam.
Based on [**Rubenlagus's library for telegram chatbots**](https://github.com/rubenlagus/TelegramBots).

## Operation
It replies to the messages sent by the user. No matter the contents, it will report on the weather in Anam-dong. The weather information is from [Naver Weather](https://weather.naver.com).

## Usage
### Creating A Bot
You can create a Telegram bot and get its token by **@BotFather**(more information on [here](https://core.telegram.org/bots)), sending a message, "/newbot".
```java
//MyAmazingBot.java
public String getBotUsername() {
		return "YourBotsName"; //Your bot's name
	}
	
	public String getBotToken() {
		return "123456789:BlahbLahBlAHblaHBlaah"; //Your bot's token
	}
```
In this way, you can apply your bot.

### Functioning
You can modify the urls and the condition of the method `execute(message)`. But since it uses web crawling method using Jsoup library, you might have to modify the 'Document' part too. You can also change the content of `generateSentence()` based on your experience.

### On Telegram
Add your bot in your friend list. While running the program, your bot will reply to your message.
